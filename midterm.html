      <h1>Friends of the Palo Alto Library Used Book Sale
      </h1>
    <p>
      At our monthly sale, we provide more than 50,000 fantastic used books, albums, DVDs, magazines, and other items. 
      These primarily come from contributions made by people, estates, and businesses. 
      We also offer books that the Palo Alto library has taken off the shelf in order to create place for new acquisitions.
