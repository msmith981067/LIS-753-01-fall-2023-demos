      We sell over 50,000 copies of wonderful used books, records, videos, magazines and more every month. 
      These include private, estate and corporate donations. 
      We also sell items taken off the shelves at Palo Alto libraries to make room for new purchases.
      Our main room is located on the north drive next to the Charleston Mall
      (See map below). In this room, hardcovers are $1 each and paperbacks are 50 cents each. 
      Please also bring your large donation of books to this room.
      Children's books, music, videos and toys are all in our new space (near Cubberley track,
      Pavilion and Greendell School), where you can find many 50-cent or $1 items, including picture books, 
      school-age fiction and nonfiction, non-English books, CDs, and DVDs,
      and books for parents and teachers. During the first hour of Saturday sales, 
      please select no more than 12 books at a time and bring them to the register where you can store them 
      until you are ready to pay for all your purchases.

      Bargain books are in rooms K6 and K7, where hardbound books are all $1, paperbacks are 50 cents, 
      and children's books are just 25 cents. On Sunday, prices in the bargain room are half-off, plus 
      you can save even more by purchasing grocery bags from us for $5 each and then filling these with books. 
      Please note that the Children's and Bargain rooms open one hour earlier than the Main room on Saturday. 
      You can purchase gift certificates at the sale in $5 denominations.
      Some customers come very early on Saturday to ensure an early place in line. 
      We hand out a maximum of two numbered tickets per person at the Main Room, 
      beginning at 8 am on the Saturday of the sale. If you receive a ticket, 
      the number on it reserves your corresponding place in the line, allowing you to go off and get coffee 
      or to visit the Children's and Bargain Book rooms. Please be sure to return to the Main Room a few minutes 
      before it opens to reclaim your spot in the line: if you miss the time when your number is allowed to enter 
      the Main Room you will forfeit your place in line. If you don't arrive in time to get a ticket, 
      please just join the latter part of the line.
    </p>

      We will only let 160 clients inside the Main Room at a time due to our severe space limits and important health 
      and safety concerns. On Saturdays, patrons will be admitted first in the order of their numbered tickets, 
      which are distributed between 8 and 11 am. Customers are only allowed to take 12 books from the shelf at a time, 
      thus you must buy them all before leaving by the east entrance. Then you can reenter in that order by joining 
      the end of the the line at the north door. If there is still a wait outside after noon, the 12-book restriction 
      will remain in effect. All of the other tens of thousands of books we have may be purchased for the same affordable pricing.
