      <p>We include over 50,000 incredible used books, records, movies, magazines, and more at our monthly sale. These are gifts from individuals, companies, and estates. The Palo Alto Library has taken certain items off its shelves that we also sell to make room for future purchases. Our Main Room is located on the north driveway, close to the Charleston Shopping Center. In this area, paperback books cost fifty cents, while hardcover novels begin at $1.00. Large book donations are also accepted in this area.</p>
        <a id="Children's Books, Videos, Toys">Children's Books, Videos, Toys Section</a>
      <p>Our new room (by the Cubberley track, Pavilion, and the Greendell School) includes an excellent selection of children's books, music, videos, and toys. Many items are available for fifty cents or $1, including picture books, school-age fiction and nonfiction, books in other languages, CDs and DVDs, and books for instructors and parents. Kindly select no more than 12 books at a time on Saturday during the first hour of the sale and bring them to the cashiers to be held until you are ready to pay for everything you have purchased.</p>
 
        <a id="Bargin Books">Bargin Books Section</a>
      <p>Paperbacks are fifty cents, children's books are just twenty-five cents, and hardbound books are all $1 in the bargain book rooms K6 and K7. The bargain room prices are cut in half on Sundays. You can also save even more money by buying grocery bags from us for $5 apiece, which you can then stuff full of books. The Children's and Bargain rooms open an hour before the Main room on Saturday. You can purchase gift certificates at the sale in $5 denominations.</p>
      <p>Some customers come very early on Saturday to ensure an early place in line. We hand out a maximum of two numbered tickets per person at the Main Room, beginning at 8 am on the Saturday of the sale. If you receive a ticket, the number on it reserves your corresponding place in the line, allowing you to go off and get coffee or to visit the Children's and Bargain Book rooms. Please be sure to return to the Main Room a few minutes before it opens to reclaim your spot in the line: if you miss the time when your number is allowed to enter the Main Room you will forfeit your place in line. If you don't arrive in time to get a ticket, please just join the latter part of the line.</p>
        <a id="Saturdays and Sundays">Saturdays and Sundays Section</a>
      <p>Due to strict space restrictions and necessary health and safety considerations, we are only allowing 160 patrons into the main room at a time. On Saturday, patrons will initially be admitted by numbered tickets, which will be issued from 8:00am to 11:00am. Once inside, customers can only take twelve books from the shelves. You should then purchase these and exit through the east gate. You can then join the end of the queue at the north gate and re-enter in that order. If there is still a line after noon, the limit of twelve books purchased at a time also applies. You will find these low-priced books among all the tens of thousands of other books we have. While some booksellers may donate a portion of your purchase to support your local library, we donate 100%. Plus, we don't charge sales tax and have the friendliest sales staff you'll ever meet.</p>
