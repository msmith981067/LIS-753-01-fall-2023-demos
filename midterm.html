<h1>Friends of the Palo Alto Library Used Book Sale
</h1>

<img src="https://riponlibrary.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/book-sale-sign.jpg" alt="Book Sales" class="featured-image">
      
<p>
We have over 50,000 wonderful used books, records, videos, magazines, and more at our monthly sale. 
These are donations from individuals, estates, and companies. 
We also sell items that the Palo Alto Library has removed from their shelves to make room for new purchases.
Our Main Room is along the north driveway, adjacent to the Charleston Shopping Center
(see map below). In this room, hardbound books start at $1 each and paperback books at 50 cents each. 
Please bring your large book donations to this room too.

<p>
Bargain books are in rooms K6 and K7, where hardbound books are all $1, paperbacks are 50 cents, and children's books are 
just 25 cents. On Sunday, prices in the bargain room are half-off, plus you can save even more by purchasing grocery bags 
from us for $5 each and then filling these with books. Please note that the Children's and Bargain rooms open one hour earlier 
than the Main room on Saturday. You can purchase gift certificates at the sale in $5 denominations.
</p>

<p>
 Some customers come very early on Saturday to ensure an early place in line. We hand out a maximum of two numbered tickets 
per person at the Main Room, beginning at 8 am on the Saturday of the sale. If you receive a ticket, the number on it reserves
your corresponding place in the line, allowing you to go off and get coffee or to visit the Children's and Bargain Book rooms. 
Please be sure to return to the Main Room a few minutes before it opens to reclaim your spot in the line: if you miss the time 
when your number is allowed to enter the Main Room you will forfeit your place in line. If you don't arrive in time to get a 
ticket, please just join the latter part of the line.
</p>

<p>
Because of our severe space limitations and compelling issues of health and safety, we will only allow 160 customers into the 
Main Room at a time. On Saturdays, customers will be originally admitted in the order of their numbered tickets that are given 
out from 8 to 11 am. Once inside, customers may take only 12 books off the shelf, after which you should purchase those and exit 
through the east door. You may then join the end of the line at the north door and reenter in that order. The limitation of 12 books 
at a time will continue past noon if a line remains outside. You'll find these same low prices on all the other tens of thousands of 
books that we have. While some booksellers may pledge a portion of your purchase to help local libraries, we give 100%. Plus, we charge 
no sales tax, and we have the friendliest salespeople you will ever find.
